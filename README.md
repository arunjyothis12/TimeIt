A simple and easy to use stopwatch library for android
## Introduction
A stopwatch can be a very important widget in an app and yet creating it has been very difficult. Creating a stopwatch requires you to create a seperate thread to keep track of the time and then post the updates on the UI thread. This process becomes complicated very quickly. Especially if you plan on adding features like pause and split.

With TimeIt, you can create a stopwatch app with very few lines of code!

For example, to create and start a stopwatch and display it with a textView :

```
Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
stopwatch.setTextView(myTextView);
stopwatch.start();
```
Pausing a stopwatch and resuming it is as simple as calling `stopwatch.pause();` and `resume()` respectively.

TimeIt also allows you to keep track of splits with the stopwatch by simply calling `stopwatch.split();`

## Features
* Easy to use stopwatch library
* No need to use seperate threads. Multithreading is handled by the library itself
* Supports pause/resume and split methods.
* Supports an `OnTickListener` to listen for updates in clock.
* Set the TextView directly with TimeIt (Automatically formats the time).
* Set custom clock delay to update the time more or less frequently!
* Much more to come!

## Documentation
TimeIt is very easy to use. If you face any trouble, you can see the javadocs [available here](https://yashovardhan99.github.io/TimeIt/JavaDocs/). A demo app is included [here](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/TimeIt/tree/master/timeit-demo) for your reference. It implements the basic features of the library.
